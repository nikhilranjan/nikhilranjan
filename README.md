##‚úçÔ∏è About Me

I am a highly organized and innovative technical communicator with a decade of experience in the development of internal training materials, customer support documentation, and printed resources. Leveraging my background in computer science engineering, I adeptly articulate essential technical concepts and narratives tailored to specific audiences. My adaptable and analytical nature, coupled with a strong attention to detail, enables me to refine and edit content effectively, thereby enhancing the overall information experience for customers. My childhood experiences during the Dot Com boom left a lasting impression, igniting my interest in technology. Throughout my school years, I cultivated a deep passion for computer science, which ultimately led me to Bangalore to pursue a degree in computer science and engineering. Moreover, I discovered a passion for writing during my academic journey. My professional career commenced at Dell, where I had the invaluable opportunity to work with and compose documentation for a diverse array of products, ranging from notebooks to advanced rack systems utilizing XML DITA infrastructure. Reflecting on my eight years at Dell, I acquired significant insights into the field of technical communication, which I found to be exceptionally rewarding. Subsequently, I was afforded the opportunity to explore various domains, including a nine-month tenure at Microsoft, where I gained firsthand experience with sample code and content management systems such as Git for the Visual Studio 2022 Release. My two years at Cisco further expanded my knowledge of data center products and facilitated my engagement in API writing and white paper development.
